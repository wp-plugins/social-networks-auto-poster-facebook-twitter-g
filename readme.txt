== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between "Free" and "Pro" versions? =

Free plugin is limited to one account per each type of connected networks. In other words you can add 1 Facebook, AND 1 Twitter AND 1 LinkedIn AND 1 etc ... accounts in the "Free" version. This is enough for about 95% of users.

<a href="http://www.nextscripts.com/social-networks-auto-poster-for-wp-multiple-accounts">SNAP Pro Plugin</a> is NOT limited in number of accounts per each type of connected networks.  You can add 10 (or 100) Facebook, AND 15 Twitter AND 5 LinkedIn AND 25 etc ... accounts in the "Pro" version. 

Please see more here: <a href="http://www.nextscripts.com/social-networks-auto-poster-pro-for-wordpress-compare-editions//">Compare Editions</a>

=  What networks in your auto-poster plugin are free and what are not? Why some networks are not free? =

All networks except Google+, Pinterest and LinkedIn Company Pages are available for free.

It really depends on the availability of the free API from the Social Network itself.
Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn and others have a very good and powerful free APIs that could be used for publishing posts. Those networks are free for you. Some networks like Google+ and Pinterest don't have API or have a read-only API that doesn't allow to make posts. We had to create our own API libraries for such networks and those libraries are available separately for some fee.

=  Does the free plugin support Wordpress Multisite (ex-WPMU)? =

Free plugin does not support Wordpress Multisite. There is a separate "Pro for WPMU" plugin available for Wordpress Multisite. Please see more here: <a href="http://www.nextscripts.com/social-networks-auto-poster-pro-for-wordpress-compare-editions//">Compare Editions</a>

= Can I use it just for Twitter (Facebook, LinkedIn, Delicious) or it requires all networks to be set? =

Sure you can use it for just one or two networks.

= Can it post to Facebook and Google+ pages? Not to profiles, but to pages. =

Yes, it can. Specify page IDs in the settings, and it will post to pages. 

= Why it's not so easy to setup? Why do I need all those apps? There are other plugins (Jetpack Publicize, Linksalpha Network Publisher, etc ) that could do it much easier. =

There is a major difference between SNAP and other auto-posting plugins. Plugin MUST use an "App" to make posts. if plugin doesn't ask you to create your own app, it will use an app set by plugin author. Yes, it's easier to setup but it means that with every post you make you will promote that plugin author to all your friends and followers. All those posts will be marked as "Shared via Wordpress.com" or "posted by Linksalpha". SNAP gives you an ability to setup your own apps and promote only yourself. We have a very detailed and illustrated setup instructions and our support can help you with that. We believe that it's well worth to spend your time by setting it up, instead of doing free advertisement for somebody else.
